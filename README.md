# My-servers-automation
Some of my scripts for servers automation. For the most part, these scripts were written independently, although some points were borrowed from open sources. The exception is "MyPostgresBackup", which is based on scripts taken from wiki.postgres.org.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub. Dependencies required for these scripts: bash, awk, cal, sed and some others.

## Usage

Run these scripts interactively or using the scheduler. An example of using the scheduler is cron_example.txt.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update the tests as appropriate.

## License

Mostly GPL and MIT I suppose.
